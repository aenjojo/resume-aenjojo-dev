# What is Next.js
Next.js is a framework for React built and developed by Vercel since 2017. Next.js was built to optimize
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of a website by rendering the page at server (SSR) or at build time (SSG).
SSR or Server-side Rendering is a method to name the process of compiling the `JSX` file into plain HTML on the server
when requested by the user, so user's browser will not download the React.js compiler and compile it on the browser.
SSG or Static Site Generation itself is similar to SSR, but their difference is when to render a page.
SSG renders only once during build time, while SSR renders on every request to the page.

# Why to use Next.js
Next.js offers many features to help developer build a react website faster, easier, and fully optimized.
Their key features are static fonts, optimized image, page-based routing, and many more.
Currently, Vercel team are building Turbopack, a continue of Webpack, to provide a very fast bundler
and will be adopted to Next.js itself. The page will be ready in few seconds
(according to the benchmark in the Turbopack website)
