# Introduction
No Idea

# Why
Next.js provides a simple way to develop a website with rich built-in features, such as SSR, file-based routing, and API.

# React Docs Statement
New react docs also have stated that if you are going to create a website fully with react, it is better to use framework
like Next.js.

Unlike many frontend framework like Vue, Angular, and Svelte, React is a library which means it needs some packages and configurations to build a website.
