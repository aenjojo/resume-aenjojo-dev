# Introduction
This is a multi-step form I created to accomplish the challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io).
I choose to do this challenge because I found that this project can be used to train my skill in React,
Redux with Redux-Toolkit (RTK), and Sass.

# The Challenge
The task is to create a web project and convert the given design to code (commonly known as slicing).
The UI result also must closely similar to the given design. I can accomplish it with my own way
and use the tech stacks I want, as long as I follow the given challenge.

The challenge given is to make a multi-step form with the following functionality:
* Complete each step of the sequence
* Go back to a previous step to update their selections
* See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
* View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
* See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
* Receive form validation messages if:
	* A field has been missed
	* The email address is not formatted correctly
	* A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

# The Consideration to Choose the Tech Stacks.
Before I decided to solve a challenge on Frontend Mentor, I was thinking to learn some technologies that I previously saw
on many jobs requirements posted in LinkedIn. Most of them are requiring a candidate to have a knowledge in Redux and Sass.
So, I looking for a project that I can solve with those technology and then found this challenge.

Actually, I want to use plain redux, since many company use it. But, as I read the official Redux documentation,
they stated that it is better to use Redux-Toolkit (RTK) to prevent many bugs that peoples might encounter
because of wrong configuration. RTK also use Redux under the hood, so it still counted as learning Redux.
An option that I would like to use to replace Redux for global state-management is Zustand. It is so easy to use,
according to what I see in their documentation. But, it still new and only few implementation in the projects out there.

I chose Sass not only because I need it for my skills, but also because it support plain css. I need that to make the
design slicing easier and faster, although I need to setup some configuration first. Sass also supported by Vite by default.

During the development, I am thinking to use GitHub for the git repository, but decided to use GitLab because I want to make
myself familiar with GitLab (in case there is a job require it).
