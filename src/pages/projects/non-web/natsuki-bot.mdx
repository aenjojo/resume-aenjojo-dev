# Introduction
**Natsuki Bot** is a discord bot I developed since 2018.
Natsuki Bot is a multi-purpose discord bot, but mostly focused on fun thingy.
Her username in discord is **Natsuki#0492**.

# History
It's name comes from a girl named Natsuki in Doki Doki Literature Club, a visual novel game created by Team Salvato.
I like Natsuki, because she is so cute with the pink hair.

I built it out of curiosity on bot development in discord, especially after some of my friends from SoloLearn also built their own bot.
It was my first time of using node.js, so the environment is a bit different from web development.
That's why when developing it, I always read a guide instead of documentation.
