# Introduction
This is my own personal website I built to store all projects I ever worked on, blog posts I wrote, and of course, my resume.
I decided to build blog here because I like to share my knowledge.

The website itself built with Next.js, because I found it is very good to build static site, like blog and resume page.
When designing the website, I look up to many blog website just to find references to create a good design and maximize the space.
I also implement MDX to create the blog posts and project posts, so I can focus on creating the content for these pages.

Actually, I have been worked on to build this website from 2021, but I keep restarting to build it, because I always end up creating a mess.
It also happened because I'm still new in developing website with Next.js.
