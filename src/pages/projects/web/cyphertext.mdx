# Introduction
**CypherText** is a simple website I build to cipher a message. I created to make me easier when I need to cipher a message.
The cipher itself is a classic cipher I ever learned during my second year at the college.

At first, I just create an implementation of the cipher in JavaScript in [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com), based on my knowledge on the cipher.
But, I found it a bit hard when it comes to cipher a message. Also, since I need to create some portfolio, I decided to built this website.

I also implement an API, just in case somebody wants to use the function from their apps.
The documentation can be found at website.
