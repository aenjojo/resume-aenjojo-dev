# Introduction
TriTravel is a mini project I created to accomplish RevoU's Software Engineer Fundamental Course assignment.
RevoU is a revolutionary online course, which they offer 2 weeks (10 days) of free course as introduction,
which I joined just to refresh my knowledge in the basic web development.
This project itself is about creating a website for a travel agency by slicing the mockup and following the brief given.

# The Requirements
In this project, although I am allowed to create it with whatever I like freely, but I must follow some requirements.
These requirements are specified in the brief, such as:
1. Follow the mockup layout and must style it with plain css (no framework).
2. The header navigation must follow these:
	* **Home** must link to the hero banner section.
	* **Our Package** must link to our package section.
	* **Call Us** must link to call us section.
3. Implement auto-slide hero banner with vanilla.js (no framework).
4. Implement basic client-side form validation with javascript (no framework).
5. Must have `index.html` and `style.css`.

Those features I said above must not use any framework and just plain css and js.
It was intentionally to make sure the learner know the fundamental and not "just use X framework" to solve it.
